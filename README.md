# LGMVIP-Web-Task-2

I'm thrilled to share the completion of my LGMVIP Web Developer Internship task - 2 â€“ building a dynamic user Dashboard! This web application fetches employee data from the ReqRes API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

# Features

1. Display employees in a grid layout.
  
2. Click the "Get Users" button to fetch employee data from the ReqRes API.

3. Show a loader while data is being fetched.

4. Responsive design with a navbar and employee cards.


I had the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies like React, Axios, and Styled Components. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided hands-on experience in API integration and front-end development.
